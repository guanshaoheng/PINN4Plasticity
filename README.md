## Objectives
+ Learn how to solve ODEs with neural networks.
+ Learn how we can use neural networks to obtain simulator free solution for forward model evaluations; using a simple example from solid mechanics.
+ See how network structure affects convergence.
+ Introduce the problem of spectral bias in DNN's and see how we can solve it.
